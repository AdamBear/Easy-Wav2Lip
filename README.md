* Forked from [wav2lip-hq-updated-ESRGAN](https://github.com/GucciFlipFlops1917/wav2lip-hq-updated-ESRGAN) by [GucciFlipFlops1917](https://github.com/GucciFlipFlops1917)


* Which fixes and improves the depreciated [Wav2LipHQ](https://github.com/Markfryazino/wav2lip-hq)

* Which is based on the original [Wav2Lip](https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip)
